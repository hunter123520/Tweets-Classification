# Deep Learning for Tweet Classification

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of deep learning models for classifying tweets into various categories (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification, hate speech detection). 

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Learning:** Advanced techniques for accurate tweet classification.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text preprocessing and feature extraction.
* **Tweet Classification:** Categorizing tweets into predefined classes.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hunter123520/Tweets-Classification]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the notebook:** Open **TWEETS Classification.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
